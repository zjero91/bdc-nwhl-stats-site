You can visit a live version of this stats tool via heroku here - https://bdc-nwhl-stats-site-f1ebd92f2c7e.herokuapp.com/

I also swapped the data with the Olympic Women's data provided in the same Big Data Cup. That version of the tool is also live and can be viewed here - https://bdc-olympic-stats-site-03bb65c2283f.herokuapp.com/
